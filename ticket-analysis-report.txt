RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Accelerate single-system migration (priority: payroll, benefits, access)
2. Publish unified policy handbook with side-by-side comparisons
3. Establish dedicated merger integration support team
4. Create FAQ based on top 20 ticket categories
5. Schedule town halls with Q&A for each legacy company cohort
6. Implement change management communications campaign
